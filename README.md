Electrical Stimulation Response Signals of Retinal Ganglion Cells in Three Wild Mice
The MEA covered with mouse retinal slices was connected to the MEA2100 data processing system and the MC_Rack software was used for electrical stimulations and signal recording from 120 electrodes. The sampling rate was configured to be 10 kHz/channel. 
The length of recording signal is 1 second. The spontaneous activity trace of 0.1 s before stimulation and the induced activity trace of 0.9 s after stimulation were recorded, respectively.
Here, a total of 3 WT mice retinas were stimulated with 17 center electrodes, and the response signals were recorded(WT1, WT2, WT3).
